CSCI3308: Final Report
======================

Booklook
--------

Zachary Doyle & Pieter Bork

* Methodology - Agile/peer code reviews
* Project Tracker - trello (largely underused)
* VCS - github.com/zedoyle/booklook (backend and rails frontend) github.com/pieterbork/booklook (node frontend)
* Each member's contributions are largely encapsulated in their repo.

Differences between plan and implementation:

* Node, not Rails.
* Indexing/mySQL left unimplemented
* Mimimal implementation doesn't sweep for correct page counts; see searcher and pager.py for details.
